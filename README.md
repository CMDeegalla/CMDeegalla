## 👩‍💻 About Me
I am a motivated Computer Networks undergraduate with hands-on experience in
routing, switching, network security, and traffic analysis. I enjoy working on
practical networking labs and documenting my learning clearly using GitHub.

I am currently seeking an **internship opportunity in Networking, NOC,
IT Infrastructure, or Network Security**, where I can apply and further develop
my technical skills.
