# Hi, I'm C. M. Deegalla 👋

🎓 **BSc (Hons) in Computer Networks**  
🏫 **NSBM Green University, Homagama**

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I am a motivated Computer Networks undergraduate with hands-on experience in
routing, switching, network security, and traffic analysis. I focus on hands-on networking labs and structured technical documentation to build verifiable, real-world networking skills.

I am currently seeking an **internship opportunity in Networking, NOC,
IT Infrastructure, or Network Security**, where I can apply and further develop
my technical skills.
